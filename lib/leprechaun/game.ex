defmodule Leprechaun.Game do
  @moduledoc """
  Leprechaun Game is controlling the progression of the game and the interface
  between all of the elements.

  The game is responsible to start a new process with all of the information
  for the game. In addition, it's also:

  - acting as an interface between the Board and the player applying the game
    rules and updating the internal data for the game: score, turns,
    extra_turns, and played_turns among others.
  - notify consumers about the progression of the game using events. But
    indeed the notifications are side-effects provoked by actions of the
    user and part of the interface.

  The game can be started using the function `start_link/1`, the only parameter
  required is the ID to localize the game. It could be a string or an atom.
  Usually from console it's more common to use an atom and from the web
  interface, based on security, it's better use strings. We are using
  `Registry` to register these names. Check the private `via/1` function.

  ## Matches

  The game consist on match 3 or more pieces together in vertical or horizontal
  way. If two (or more) matches are adjacent, they are merged in a "mixed"
  match which is including all of the points which are matching. For example:

  ```
  1 1 1 2 3 4
  1 2 2 3 4 5
  1 2 3 4 5 4
  2 3 4 5 4 3
  ```

  For this board (6x4) we can find two matches:

  - `horizontal` in the first row, we can see three 1s from the point (1, 1).
    It is going to generate a match including the points: (1, 1), (2, 1), and
    (3, 1).
  - `vertical` in the first column, we can see three 1s from the point (1, 1).
    It is going to generate a match including the points: (1, 1), (1, 2), and
    (1, 3).

  Because these matches has a common point (1, 1), they are `mixed` which mean
  the system is going to merge them and generate only a `mixed` match with a
  set of all of the points inside.

  ##Â Chain-reaction

  Because a match in sliding the pieces on top of this element and adding new
  pieces generated from `Leprechaun.Board.Piece.new/0`, it's possible to find
  new matches. We count the first set of matches as the _first move_, because
  with the move we are getting matches around that move.

  The following matches could be not related to the place where the move took
  place. These are the matches of the chain-reaction or _no first move_
  matches.

  ## Special moves

  The special moves available for this game are the following ones:

  - match 4 pieces: keep turn. It's triggering the event `{:extra_turn, 1}` and
    it's intended to keep the turn, it means you're no loosing a turn in this
    move.
  - match 5+ pieces: extra turn. It's triggering the event `{:extra_turn, 2}`
    and it's meaning you add a new turn instead of loosing it. In addition,
    it triggers the possibility to get a clover (1:3 or 33%, see
    `Leprechaun.Board` module).
  - clover: moving the clover with another piece is levelling-up this piece,
    i.e. moving a clover with a bronze piece, it's converting all of the bronze
    pieces on the board to silver ones.
  - leprechaun: moving the leprechaun with another piece is matching all of
    this kind of pieces in a big _mixed_ match.
